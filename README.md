# Twitter Threader

**Twitter Threader** is a little tool for you if you can't get your point across in only 280 characters, but still want your twitter followers to see your rant. Simply write your text in the textfield and see the thread get generated. The thread will be numbered and the tweets easily copied to your clipboard upon clicking them.

There are several similar options:

- [Chirr App](https://getchirrapp.com/) (posts directly to your twitter)
- [Twitter Thread Maker](https://twitterthreadmaker.com/)
- [Twitter Thread Generator](https://christopherkade.com/twitter-thread-generator/)
